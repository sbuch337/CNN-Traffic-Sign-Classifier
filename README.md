# CNN-Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Masters in Data Science Capstone MidTerm

The goal of this project was to build a traffic sign classifier using a convolution neural network, CNN. The images provided simulate real driving conditions such as low light, different angles to the camera and different distances away from the camera.  The resulting classifier had an overall test accuracy of 97.8%.  The classes with the highest F-score were speed limit, stop, priority road, no passing and and yield signs while the classes with the lowest F-score included traffic signals, roundabout mandatory, pedestrians, beware of ice/snow and double curve signs.
